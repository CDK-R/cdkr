pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package. You can see pkgdown in action at <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org>: this is the output of pkgdown applied to the latest version of pkgdown. Learn more in `vignette("pkgdown")` or `?build_site`.

## Installation

::: .rcdk-release
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("rcdk")
```
:::

::: .rcdk-devel
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-lib/rcdk")
```
:::

## Usage

Get started with [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run once to configure your package to use pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```

Then use pkgdown to build your website:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This generates a `docs/` directory containing a website. Your `README.md` becomes the homepage, documentation in `man/` generates a function reference, and vignettes will be rendered into `articles/`. Read `vignette("pkgdown")` for more details, and to learn how to deploy your site to GitHub pages.
