	* man/loadmol.Rd: Added examples for using load.molecules

	* R/iterating.R (hasNext.iload.molecules): Made more robust by
	checking that the file exists before trying to load it

	* R/io.R (load.molecules): If non-existant file is specified we
	now report the error properly

	of the OS X helper. This allows users on OS X to view single
	molecules in a Swing window and copy PNG depictions to the system clipboard

	* R/desc.R (get.volume): Added helper method to get molecular
	volume based on the VABC method.

	(get.fingerprint): Added support for the new Hybridization fingerprinter

	* man/viewmol2d.Rd: Updated man page for the new clipboard
	copy method

	* R/visual.R (copy.image.to.clipboard): Added function
	to copy 2D depiction to system clipboard

	* Updated to latest stable CDK release

2011-05-06  Rajarshi Guha  <guhar@guest-193-062-206-199.wtgc.org>

	* man/gettotalcharge.Rd: Added man page entry for the total
	formal charge function.

	* R/rcdk.R (get.total.formal.charge): Added new function to 
	return the total formal charge. Also updated get.total.charge
	to recognize when partial charges are unset and in such a case
	return the sum of formal charges

2011-02-20  Rajarshi Guha  <guhar@Rajarshi-Guha-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* Updated CDK jar file to latest master plus some
	cherry picks from 1.4

	* NAMESPACE: Added a specific export for hasNext

2010-11-08  Rajarshi Guha  <guhar@office>

	* R/rcdk.R (get.exact.mass): Updated to check for exception when
	getting exact mass and print a more useful message.
	(get.natural.mass): Same as above

2010-11-07  Rajarshi Guha  <guhar@Rajarshi-Guha-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* man/getproperty.Rd: Updated man page for get.title

	of a molecule.

	* inst/doc/rcdk.Rnw (section{Input / Output}): Added a description
	of how to use the iterating version of the molecule loader

	* R/iterating.R (nextEl): Updated iterator so that we don't skip 
	the first molecule. Also reorganized the code so that it makes
	more sense

2010-10-21  Rajarshi Guha  <guhar@Rajarshi-Guha-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* Updated to latest CDK (1.4.x) which resolves bugs in formula
	generation and reading SD tags consisting of single spaces. Also
	updates to Murkco fragmentatin code which ensures that the proper
	fragments are returned when requested as molecule objects. This
	version also includes 3 new descriptors (FMF, acidic group and
	basic group counts).
