Description: This package provides the CDK libraries for use
 in the R environment. Given the size of the library itself, 
 this package is not expected to change very frequently. To make
 use of the CDK within R, it is suggested that you use the rcdk 
 package. Note that it is possible to directly interact with the CDK
 using rJava. However rcdk exposes functionality in a more idiomatic way.
 The CDK library itself is released as LGPL and the sources can be
 obtained from https://github.com/cdk/cdk
