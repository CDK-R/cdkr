Description: Access PubChem data (compounds, substance, assays).
        Structural information is provided in the form of SMILES
        strings. This package only provides access to a subset of the
        precalculated data stored by PubChem. Bio-assay data can be
        accessed to obtain descriptions as well as the actual data. It
        is also possible to search for assay ID's by keyword. Currently
        the main limitation is that only 1000 molecules can be
        downloaded at a time from the PubChem servers
