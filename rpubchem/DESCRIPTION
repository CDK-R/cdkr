Description: Access PubChem data (compounds, substance, assays) using R 
 (see <https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/> for more information about PubChem).
 Structural information is provided in the form of SMILES strings. 
 It currently only provides access to a subset of the 
 precalculated data stored by PubChem. Bio-assay data can be accessed to 
 obtain descriptions as well as the actual data. It is also possible to search for assay ID's by keyword.
